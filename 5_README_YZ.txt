This folder consists of four demo datasets that can be used to test SysMet as outlined below. 



1. Putative_Identification.csv consists of hundreds of m/z values along with putative IDs. The dataset can be used to test the Putative ID Prioritization App, which assigns scores to the putative IDs based on a probabilistic network. 



2. Differential_Analysis.csv consists of the levels of 88 metabolites measured in serum samples from 120 subjects (60 cancer cases and 60 controls). It can be used to test the Differential Analysis App, which uses a network-based method to find metabolites that distinguish the two groups of subjects. 



3. Multiomic_Metabo.csv and Multiomic_Proteo consist of the measurement of 66 metabolites and 100 proteins measured in plasma from 89 subjects (49 cancer cases and 40 controls). This dataset can be used to test the Multi-omic Data Integration App, which combines a metabolomic dataset with another omic datasets to identify metabolites that distinguish the two groups of subjects by mapping proteins onto a network built using the metabolomic data.
