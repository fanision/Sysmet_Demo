This folder consists of three demo datasets (Demo1, Demo2, and Demo3) that can be used to test SysMet. The demo datasets consist of putative metabolite IDs obtained using MetaboCraft. Demo1 and Demo2 include a small number of putative IDs. They can be used to test SySMet quickly(due to the small size of Demo1, the score dose not possesses biological meaning). Demo3 includes a large number of putative IDs. It can be used for a comprehensive evaluation of SysMet.
