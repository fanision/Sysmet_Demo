This folder consists of four demo datasets that can be used to test SysMet as outlined below. 



1. Putative_Identification.csv consists of hundreds of m/z values along with putative IDs. The dataset can be used to test the Putative ID Prioritization Tool, which assigns scores to the putative IDs based on a probabilistic model. 



2. Differential_Analysis.csv consists of the levels of 88 metabolites measured in serum samples from 120 subjects (60 cancer cases and 60 controls). It can be used to test the Differential Analysis Tool, which uses a network-based method to find metabolites that distinguish the two groups of subjects. 



3. Multiomic_Metabo.csv and Multiomic_Proteo consist of the measurement of 66 metabolites and 100 proteins measured in plasma samples from 89 subjects (49 cancer cases and 40 controls). These datasets can be used to test the Multi-omic Data Integration Tool, which combines a metabolomic dataset with another omic datasets (e.g., proteomic dataset, transcriptomic dataset, etc.) to identify metabolites that distinguish two groups of samples by mapping biomolecules (e.g., proteins, genes, etc.) onto a network previously built using metabolomic data.
